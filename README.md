# Unicorn Companies Data Analysis

This was data analytics project exploring and visualising Unicorn Companies. 
A Unicorn is a private company that is worth more than $1B. I implemented a stack involving 
Python, Postgresql and Tableau. 

I used Python to clean and transform my data before I pushed it to a SQL database. I then used the databsse
to produce qeuries to examine the data and generate actionable insights that I could visualise. 

## How to Run the Project
All files are provided to reproduce this project. However the Tableau workbook is available 
here:

## Key Callouts
- There is an extreme disparity between continents in regards to funding. This is reflected in the number of Unicorns each continent produced. 
- The number of unicorns seems to lag behind funding. From 2016-2019 funding far exceed the porportion of new unicorns however an extreme spike was then observed in 2021. 
- Unicorns are spread across a wide range of industries and countries. Allowing for safer and more diversified investments which is evident by the 600+% return.
